# Welcome to FED Training

> This repo aims at providing the resources and exercises for self-learning to get up to speed with existing FED tools and technologies. 

## How to use
Go over the list of topics one-by-one. Most topics have a list of recommended resources to read or watch on your own. We encourage you to search for more. Google is your best friend. 

Each topic contains the exercise or a small project that you have to implement and review with your mentor. Topics that are shown in `[]` are optional but very much recommended. This list does *not* contain any redundant topics.

If you feel lost on your path, you can take a look at the [FED roadmap](./assets/frontend-roadmap.png), track your progress and see the big picture.
